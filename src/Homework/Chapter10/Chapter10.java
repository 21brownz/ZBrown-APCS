    // 4) Find out by looking it up in the Java 8 API specifications whether the String and Color classes have copy constructors
    // String does, color doesn't

    //5) Java's class Color has a constructor that takes three integers as parameters:
    // the red, green and blue components of the color. A class Balloon has two fields:
    // double radius and Color color. Write a constructor for the Balloon class that takes no parameters
    // and sets the balloon's radius to 10 and its color to "sky blue" (with RGB values 135, 206, and 250).
